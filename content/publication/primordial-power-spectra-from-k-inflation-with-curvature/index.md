abstract: We investigate the primordial power spectra for general kinetic
  inflation models that support a period of kinetic dominance in the case of
  curved universes. We present derivations of the Mukhanov-Sasaki equations with
  a nonstandard scalar kinetic Lagrangian which manifests itself through the
  inflationary sound speed c<sup>2</sup><sub>s</sub>. We extend the analytical
  approximations exploited in Contaldi et al [1] and Thavanesan et al [2] to
  general kinetic Lagrangians and show the effect of k-inflation on the
  primordial power spectra for models with curvature. In particular, the
  interplay between sound speed and curvature results in a natural low
  wavenumber cutoff for the power spectra in the case of closed universes. Using
  the analytical approximation, we further show that a change in the
  inflationary sound speed between different epochs of inflation results in
  non-decaying oscillations in the resultant power spectra for the comoving
  curvature perturbation.
