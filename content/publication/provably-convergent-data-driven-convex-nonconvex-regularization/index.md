abstract: "An emerging new paradigm for solving inverse problems is via the use
  of deep learning to learn a regularizer from data. This leads to high-quality
  results, but often at the cost of provable guarantees. In this work, we show
  how well-posedness and convergent regularization arises within the
  convex-nonconvex (CNC) framework for inverse problems. We introduce a novel
  input weakly convex neural network (IWCNN) construction to adapt the method of
  learned adversarial regularization to the CNC framework. Empirically we show
  that our method overcomes numerical issues of previous adversarial methods. "
