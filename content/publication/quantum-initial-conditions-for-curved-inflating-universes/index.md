abstract: We discuss the challenges of motivating, constructing, and quantising
  a canonically-normalised inflationary perturbation in spatially curved
  universes. We show that this has historically proved challenging due to the
  interaction of non-adiabaticity with spatial curvature. We propose a novel
  curvature perturbation which is canonically normalised, unique up to a single
  scalar parameter. This corrected quantisation has potentially observational
  consequences via modifications to the primordial power spectrum at large
  angular scales, as well as theoretical implications for quantisation
  procedures in curved cosmologies filled with a scalar field.
