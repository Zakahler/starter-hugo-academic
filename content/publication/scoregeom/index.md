abstract: "Data-driven Riemannian geometry has emerged as a powerful tool for
  interpretable representation learning, offering improved efficiency in
  downstream tasks. Moving forward, it is crucial to balance cheap manifold
  mappings with efficient training algorithms. In this work, we integrate
  concepts from pullback Riemannian geometry and generative models to propose a
  framework for data-driven Riemannian geometry that is scalable in both
  geometry and learning: score-based pullback Riemannian geometry. Focusing on
  unimodal distributions as a first step, we propose a score-based Riemannian
  structure with closed-form geodesics that pass through the data probability
  density. With this structure, we construct a Riemannian autoencoder (RAE) with
  error bounds for discovering the correct data manifold dimension. This
  framework can naturally be used with anisotropic normalizing flows by adopting
  isometry regularization during training. Through numerical experiments on
  various datasets, we demonstrate that our framework not only produces
  high-quality geodesics through the data support, but also reliably estimates
  the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold and provides a global chart of
  the manifold, even in high-dimensional ambient spaces. "
