I am a PhD student under supervision of Professor Carola Schönlieb at the [Cambridge Image Analysis Group](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis) within DAMTP. I am also a member of the [Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information](https://www.ccimi.maths.cam.ac.uk/) and the [Maths4DL programme](https://maths4dl.ac.uk/team-member/zak-shumaylov/). I am currently a Student Researcher @ GDM in Mountain View, working on some Inverse Lithography. Before this, I worked as an ML Research Intern at Apple, focusing on model compression.

I am generally interested in applied mathematics, specifically various problems arising at the intersection of optimization, deep learning, geometry, and inverse problems.

So far in my PhD I have focused on the areas of geometric deep learning and physics informed machine learning.
